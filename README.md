Some people says that this is not a language...

> It means "HyperText Markup Language", at the end says language, so i think is it
>> This was my first learned language when i was 8, and i really liked it.
>>> The elements are represented with "< >" "</ >". (Or named as tags)
>>>> I really like that i can see the results in my navigator instead of watching it on the same B&W console

### Ecologic Project: "Climate Change" ###

  - I remember how enthusiasted I was when someone said "You can change people's view with words", and after that i thought "I need to create a page to explain more about the climate change. No matter what, but i want to do it". This page is a little bit outdated, but someday i am gonna update it to create a fresh page to talk about climate change <3.
